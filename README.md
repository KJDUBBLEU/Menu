# Menu
a launcher for different applications to go onto your desktop using rainmeter
so long story short ive been working on getting different animations to work inside of this launcher UI but whenever i try to add a time function to the code the entirety of the program begins to collapse.
if anyone could send me a revision of this that could fix my issue i would be eternally grateful lol
